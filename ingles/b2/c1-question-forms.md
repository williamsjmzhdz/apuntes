# 1. Question forms

## Subject + verb

In questions we usually put the subject after the first verb.

**Subject + verb**

John | will => will John? => Will John be late?

You | have => have you? = > Have you started?

The hotel | was => was the hotel? => Was the hotel nice?

But be careful! If you have more than one verb **remember** that the **subject** comes after the **first verb**. For example: **Is Emily working today?**

## Using auxilary verbs

In present simple questions use **do** / **does**:

you live => **do** you live? => **Do** you live far?

the film start => **does** the film start? => When **does** the film start?

In past simple questions use **did**:

you sold => **Did** you sell? => **Did** you sell your car?

the rain stopped => **Did** the rain stop? => When **did** the rain stop?
